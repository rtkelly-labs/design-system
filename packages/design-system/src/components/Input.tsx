/**
 * Form controls — the reference for how a component in this system is built.
 *
 * Three things to copy from here:
 *
 *   1. **Every colour addresses a role.** `bg-surface-base`,
 *      `text-content-primary`, `border-edge-strong`, `text-intent-danger`. Every
 *      level is styled by the same classes, and a new one would be too.
 *   2. **Styling is a `recipe`, not a template string.** The recipe has one
 *      slot per element, so a consumer can reach any of them, and conflicts
 *      resolve — a caller's `bg-surface-raised` genuinely replaces the base's
 *      `bg-surface-base` rather than racing it in CSS source order.
 *   3. **Runtime values stay out of the class string.** The focus accent comes
 *      from a prop, so it travels as a custom property; a utility cannot be
 *      assembled at build time from a value known only at runtime.
 *
 * The label, message and ARIA wiring are not here: they are `FieldFrame` in
 * `./fieldFrame`, shared with `Checkbox` and `Switch` so that one field
 * implementation serves every control.
 */

/**
 * The control every text-shaped field wears: `Input`, `TextArea`, and both of
 * `Select`'s presentations — the native `<select>` and the listbox trigger.
 *
 * Exported for `./Select` (#164), whose closed trigger has to look like the
 * native control it replaced — one recipe is what makes that true rather than
 * approximately true. `src/index.ts` names this module's exports rather than
 * re-exporting it wholesale, so the recipe, and the `tailwind-variants` type
 * it carries, stays out of the published `.d.ts`.

     * outline from this slot defeats that rule: the utility carries a class and
     * a pseudo-class, so it outranks the bare `:focus-visible` selector and
     * wins on exactly the keyboard focus the rule exists to cover.
