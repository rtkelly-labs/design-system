/**
 * Does every component actually document itself on its Storybook docs page?
 *
 * `check-visual-coverage.mjs` asks whether a component is *screenshotted*. This
 * asks the other question — whether a reader (or an agent) arriving at
 * `Components/Content/Badge` is told what the thing is for, what its props mean, and
 * what the samples are demonstrating. Storybook will happily publish a docs
 * page consisting of a title, an untitled control table with an empty
 * Description column, and one story called "Default", and nothing about that
 * page says it is empty. It looks documented.
 *
 * ## The five things a component page needs
 *
 * 1. **A page at all** — `tags: ['autodocs']` on the meta. Without it the
 *    component has stories and no docs entry, which is the only state here that
 *    is invisible rather than merely thin.
 * 2. **A description of the component** — one or more paragraphs saying what it
 *    is for and when to reach for it. Preferred as a JSDoc block on the
 *    exported component, because that also reaches editor hover and the emitted
 *    `.d.ts`; `parameters.docs.description.component` is accepted for the cases
 *    where the component is not the natural home for the prose.
 * 3. **At least three samples.** One story shows that a component renders.
 *    Three force the axis it varies on to be stated — emphasis vs intent, the
 *    link form vs the button form, the empty state. A component that genuinely
 *    has one form belongs in `EXCLUDED` with that written down.
 * 4. **A description on every story**, as a JSDoc block above the export. This
 *    is the caption under the sample, and it is where the guidance that matters
 *    to a consumer lives: not "the pink one" but *when* the pink one is right.
 * 5. **A description on every prop.** The props table is generated whether or
 *    not anyone wrote the Description column, so an undocumented prop is not a
 *    gap on the page — it is a blank cell that reads as "self-explanatory".
 *
 * ## Why this reads source rather than the built Storybook
 *
 * `check-visual-coverage.mjs` reads `storybook-static/index.json` because it has
 * to: what is *asserted* is only knowable from the built index. Everything here
 * is a property of the source, so this runs without a Storybook build — which
 * is what lets it sit in the `gates` job rather than behind the browser install
 * (AGENTS.md § CI Shape).
 *
 * Prop discovery is deliberately syntactic: the members declared by the props
 * type in the component's own file, following unions, intersections and locally
 * declared aliases, and stopping at anything imported (`HTMLAttributes` and
 * friends are React's to document, not ours). That is the same set
 * `react-docgen` puts in the table — except where react-docgen gives up
 * entirely, which it does on `Button`'s discriminated union, emitting zero
 * props for the most-used component in the package. A props table that is
 * *empty* passes any check that trusts the generator, so this does not trust
 * it: it finds the props from the type and requires either a JSDoc on the
 * member or an `argTypes` entry that describes it.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-story-docs.mjs           fail if a page is under-documented
 *   node scripts/check-story-docs.mjs --list    show every gap, component by component

 * for once and can then be disagreed with.
 *
 * `CEILING` below is not a contradiction of that, and is not a waiver: no

 * bound on how many components may be below standard at once, so that the

 * components are short of the five things a page needs, across 264 individual
 * gaps. Two honest options existed. Hold the gate back until someone writes 159
 * story captions and 229 prop descriptions — which is content work, and
 * generating that prose mechanically would produce exactly the blank-cell-shaped
 * filler this gate exists to catch. Or land it bounding the damage today and
 * ratchet down, which is what `check:lint-budget`, `check:css` and
 * `check:component-docs` all do.
 *
 * So: every gap is printed on every run, nothing is waived, and the number may
 * never rise. Lower it in the same commit that documents a component. This gate
 * is finished when the number is 0 and this constant is deleted.
